# BoTorch-optim
## Getting Started
* Minimum python version 3.7
* Required packages listed below
```
pip install botorch
pip install ax-platform
pip install numpy
```
## What's done
### BoTorch-Test
A test function, namely branin function, is used for testing and understanding the botorch package.
```
python botorch-test
```
The optimization problem for the brainin function is global minimization. There are 3 global minimum points with value 0.397887. The points for this value can be seen below:
```
(x1 = -π, x2 = 12.275)
(x1 = π, x2 = 2.275)
(x1 = 9.42478, x2 = 2.475)
```
The expected output of this test code is a coordinate close to either of these 3 points with a value close to the minimum value 0.397887.
